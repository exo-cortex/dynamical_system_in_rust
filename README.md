# Reservoir computing with dynamical systems in Rust
A programm to integrate dynamical systems written in Rust.

At the moment it is capable of calculating the Lang-Kobayashi- and Mackey-Glass-system.

This Program is mainly for learning Rust. Right now it can only integrate the Lang-Kobayashi- and Mackey-Glass system and then write out the dynamical variables. There's a simple `plot.py` script to see the timeseries.

## implemented features
- ### traits
    - dynamical systems
    - dynamical systems with feedback

- timeseries simplification via RDP[^2] to greatly reduce file sizes
- runge-kutta-4 integration method for delay-differential equations
- dynamical systems: Lang-Kobayashi, Mackey-Glass, Stuart-Landau, Hindmarsh-Rose, Lorenz
- multi-delay network topologies.

## todos
- optimize the perpendicular distance from a point to a line in n dimensions.
- functionality to simplify n-dimensional trajectories into individual one-dimensional time-series
- implement differential equations with delay
