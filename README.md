# Reservoir computing with dynamical systems in Rust
A programm to integrate dynamical systems written in Rust.

At the moment it is capable of calculating the Lang-Kobayashi- and Mackey-Glass-system.

This Program is mainly for learning Rust. Right now it can only integrate the Lang-Kobayashi- and Mackey-Glass system and then write out the dynamical variables. There's a simple `plot.py` script to see the timeseries.

## implemented features
- timeseries simplification via RDP[^2] to greatly reduce file sizes
- runge-kutta-4 integration method for delay-differential equations
- dynamical systems: Lang-Kobayashi, Mackey-Glass, Stuart-Landau, Hindmarsh-Rose, Lorenz, FitzHugh-Nagumo
- multi-delay network topologies.

### traits
- dynamical systems
- dynamical systems with feedback

## todos
- ### add more dynamical systems
    - RÃ¶ssler
    - Van der Pol oscillator
    - Kuramoto-oscillator

- ### reservoir computing benchmarks
    - NARMA
    - Legendre-functions
    - prediction of dynamical-systems

- ### saving parametric plots
    - save n-dimensional curves
    - use derive possible variable-indices from system-variables

- ### network
    - make network generic in regards to the type of weights `WeightT`
    - make network's delays an `Option`
    - network with "no" weights (all weights = 1)
    - normalize weights by node's total output

- ### curve simplification
- optimize the perpendicular distance from a point to a line in n dimensions.

### traits
    - implement generalized `FeedbackType`-trait to allow each system define a specific type of feedback.
    - implement generalized `Weight`-trait to make network generic (`Network<T: WeightT>`)
    right now only two types of delayed-Feedback are possible : `Complex<f64>` and `f64`
    but systems might want `[f64; 3]` as Feedback-type and something similar to a matrix as weight.
    That way each system can have each feedback-input be a weighted sum of the state's variables.
    - systems with noise
    - systems with external driving force (needed for reservoir computing)
